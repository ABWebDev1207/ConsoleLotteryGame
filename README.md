# Bede Lottery Game

A simplified lottery game console application built with C# and .NET 9, demonstrating professional software engineering practices including SOLID principles, dependency injection, comprehensive testing, and enterprise-grade architecture.

## 🎯 Overview

This application simulates a lottery game where 10-15 players (including one human player) purchase tickets and compete for prizes distributed across three tiers. The implementation showcases modern C# development practices with clean architecture, extensive testing, configurable game rules, and production-ready patterns.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Principles

### SOLID Principles Implementation

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single, well-defined purpose
  - `Player`: Manages player state and ticket purchases only
  - `Ticket`: Represents individual lottery tickets with winner state
  - `LotteryGame`: Orchestrates the overall game state and flow
  - `PrizeCalculationService`: Handles all prize-related calculations and distributions
  - `PlayerService`: Manages player creation, validation, and CPU behavior
  - `GameUIService`: Handles all user interface interactions and display logic

- **Open/Closed Principle**: Services are open for extension but closed for modification
  - Interface-based design allows for easy extension without modifying existing code
  - Factory pattern enables different random number generator implementations
  - Configuration system allows behavior changes without code modification

- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: All implementations are substitutable for their interfaces
  - `IRandomNumberGenerator` implementations (standard, seeded, secure) are interchangeable
  - Service interfaces can be swapped without breaking functionality
  - Mock implementations in tests demonstrate substitutability

- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are focused and specific
  - `IPlayerService`, `IPrizeCalculationService`, `IGameUIService` have focused responsibilities
  - No client is forced to depend on methods it doesn't use
  - Separate interfaces for different concerns (UI, business logic, infrastructure)

- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
  - All services depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations
  - Dependencies are injected through constructor injection
  - Configuration is abstracted through `IOptions<T>` pattern

### Clean Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
├── Models/              # Domain entities (no dependencies)
├── Interfaces/          # Abstractions and contracts
├── Services/            # Business logic implementations
├── Configuration/       # Strongly-typed configuration classes
├── Extensions/          # Dependency injection setup
├── HealthChecks/        # Application health monitoring
└── Program.cs           # Composition root and entry point
```

### Advanced Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: `IRandomNumberGeneratorFactory` for creating different RNG types
- **Options Pattern**: Strongly-typed configuration with `IOptions<GameConfiguration>`
- **Builder Pattern**: Test data builders for improved test readability
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different random number generation strategies
- **Service Locator**: Proper dependency injection container usage

## 🔧 Advanced Dependency Injection

The application demonstrates enterprise-grade dependency injection patterns:

### Service Lifetimes
- **Singleton**: Infrastructure services (`IRandomNumberGenerator`, `IConsoleService`)
  - Stateless services that are expensive to create
  - Shared across the entire application lifetime
- **Scoped**: Business services (`IPlayerService`, `ILotteryGameService`)
  - Per-game isolation ensures clean state between games
  - Proper resource management and disposal
- **Transient**: Not used (no lightweight, frequently-created services)

### Advanced DI Features
- **Extension Methods**: `ServiceCollectionExtensions` for organized registration
- **Configuration Validation**: `IValidateOptions<T>` for startup validation
- **Health Checks**: Configuration and service health monitoring
- **Factory Registration**: Factory pattern integration with DI container
- **Logging Integration**: Structured logging with proper DI setup

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Strategy

Multi-layered testing approach ensuring high quality and reliability:

### Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with comprehensive mocking
- **Integration Tests**: Service interaction and dependency testing
- **Behavior-Driven Tests**: End-to-end scenario testing with Given-When-Then structure
- **Configuration Tests**: Validation, edge cases, and invalid configuration handling
- **Theory Tests**: Parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios

### Test Quality Features
- **Test Data Builders**: Eliminate duplication and improve readability
- **Configuration Helpers**: Shared test configuration creation
- **Comprehensive Mocking**: Proper isolation of units under test
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **BDD Scenarios**: Real-world usage patterns and user stories

## ⚙️ Configuration System

Enterprise-grade configuration management:

### Features
- **Strongly-Typed Configuration**: Type-safe configuration classes
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation with meaningful error messages
- **Environment Support**: Development, staging, production configurations
- **Hot Reload**: Configuration changes without application restart
- **Hierarchical Configuration**: JSON files, environment variables, command line

### Configuration Structure
```json

  "GameConfiguration": {
    "Players": {
      "MinimumCount": 10,
      "MaximumCount": 15,

    },
    "Display": {
      "ShowDetailedResults": true,
      "ShowPrizeBreakdown": true,
      "ClearScreenBetweenPhases": true
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎮 Game Rules

- **Ticket Price**: Configurable (default $1 each)
- **Ticket Limits**: Configurable (default 1-10 tickets per player)
- **Prize Distribution**:
  - Grand Prize: 50% of revenue (1 winner)
  - Second Tier: 30% of revenue (10% of tickets win)
  - Third Tier: 10% of revenue (20% of tickets win)
  - House Profit: 10% of revenue
